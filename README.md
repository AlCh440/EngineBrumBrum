# Fountian Engine
## Descrtiption
Fountain engine is a new engine specifically designed for videogames, in c++ for learning purposes.

This Engine has been created in the CITM subject "Engines" by 2 members in the 3rd course. The main objective of this project is to learn and improve our programming skills. To do our engine we have implmented what we have learned this year in this subject, and also we had to use our knowledge learned through the course. Actually isn't the most optimized engine on the market, but one day it will be as powerfull as other engines.

This engine is completely free.
